# Tic-Tac-Toe Data Assembler
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.
## Install project
`yarn`

## Run project
`yarn dev`

## Process
First of all I created an basic simple app with Parcel. I started with the board, I created the boxes and created an click handler. After that I created player 1 and 2, and changed the actions of the 'x' and 'o' depending on the player. Then I created the function checkWinner, to check if there is an winner after the click. With this the basic game is finished.

Now I add localStorage to the project, so I can create a scoreboard.
